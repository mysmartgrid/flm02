This git repo contains the code needed for builing an OpenWRT Attitude Adjustment-based
firmware for the Fluksometer v2, aka FLM02.

This firmware is a fork of the original Flukso firmware [github.com/flukso/flm02]
tailored for the use with the mySmartGrid platform.

avr: AVR microcontroller code for the v2 Flukso sensor board

docs: LaTeX sources of the Fluksometer Manual

eagle: Eagle schematic, board and BOM files for building a v2 Flukso sensor
board

modules: CMake modules for initializing the OpenWRT SDK

openwrt: the modules, patches and scripts needed to tailor a stock OpenWRT
Attitude Adjustment to the Fluksometer hardware.

tools: a set of helper tools for flashing, generating boardconfigs, etc.

### OpenWRT build instructions ###
To build the firmware create a directory outside the source directory and
run 'cmake $SOURCEDIR' where $SOURCEDIR is the path to the directory
containing this README.
Make sure you ran 'git submodule init && git submodule update' before building
the firmware.

#### Troubleshooting ####
In case the build process fails due to errors in the packages feed of OpenWRT
one can execute the following steps to revert back to a working commit.

cd $BUILDDIR/feeds/packages
git fetch --unshallow
git checkout $COMMITHASH
cd $BUILDDIR
cmake -Dopenwrt_update_feeds=OFF $SOURCEDIR
make

In order to get back to upstream you have to execute the following steps

cd $BUILDDIR/feeds/packages
git checkout master
cd $BUILDDIR
cmake -Dopenwrt_update_feeds=ON $SOURCEDIR
make
