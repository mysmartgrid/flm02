TODO list:
[ ] 868MHz link range testing
[ ] implement a soft uart for state machine debugging
[ ] add a strict priority queue for tx'ing acks
[ ] merge code with existing flukso functionality
[ ] substitute the _delay_ms in the main loop with a timing condition
[ ] test how much higher we can set the rf link baud rate
[ ] test how fast we can clock the spi bus between MIPS and AVR
[ ] revisit the power loss detection code for it to cope with a 3.3V rail and 16MHz clock
